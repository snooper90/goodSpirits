Inversion I.P.A. is a phenomenal NW-style I.P.A., beckoning all beer drinkers and enticing I.P.A. lovers to invert their world and find clarity above the routine of the everyday.","last_mod":"2010-07-22 20:00:20","":null},{"_id":424,"brewery_id":844,"name":"India Pale Ale","cat_id":3,"style_id":26,"abv":7.5,"ibu":0,"srm":0,"upc":0,"filepath":null,"descript":null,"last_mod":"2010-07-22 20:00:20","":null},{"_id":425,"brewery_id":844,"name":"London Porter","cat_id":2,"style_id":25,"abv":6.5,"ibu":0,"srm":0,"upc":0,"filepath":null,"descript":null,"last_mod":"2010-07-22 20:00:20","":null},{"_id":426,"brewery_id":742,"name":"Hitachino Nest Celebration Ale 2006","cat_id":-1,"style_id":-1,"abv":9,"ibu":0,"srm":0,"upc":0,"filepath":null,"descript":null,"last_mod":"2010-07-22 20:00:20","":null},{"_id":427,"brewery_id":363,"name":"Rubia","cat_id":8,"style_id":95,"abv":6,"ibu":0,"srm":0,"upc":0,"filepath":null,"descript":null,"last_mod":"2010-07-22 20:00:20","":null},{"_id":428,"brewery_id":562,"name":"Session Premium Lager","cat_id":8,"style_id":95,"abv":5.1,"ibu":0,"srm":0,"upc":0,"filepath":null,"descript":null,"last_mod":"2010-07-22 20:00:20","":null},{"_id":429,"brewery_id":156,"name":"Mocny BOSS / BOSS Beer","cat_id":8,"style_id":95,"abv":8.1,"ibu":0,"srm":0,"upc":0,"filepath":null,"descript":null,"last_mod":"2010-07-22 20:00:20","":null},{"_id":430,"brewery_id":127,"name":"La Rossa","cat_id":7,"style_id":90,"abv":7.2,"ibu":0,"srm":0,"upc":0,"filepath":null,"descript":null,"last_mod":"2010-07-22 20:00:20","":null},{"_id":431,"brewery_id":905,"name":"Blue Paddle Pilsener","cat_id":7,"style_id":77,"abv":4.8,"ibu":0,"srm":0,"upc":0,"filepath":null,"descript":"Climb on in and grab a paddle.

An almost viscous, inky-black brew, Yeti opens with a massive, roasty, chocolate, coffee malt flavor that eventually gives way to rich toffee and burnt caramel notes. Packed with an enormous quantity of American hops, Yetiâ€™s hop profile reveals a slightly citrusy, piney, and wonderfully dry hoppy finish.","last_mod":"2010-07-22 20:00:20","":null},{"_id":834,"brewery_id":745,"name":"Hefe-Weizen Dunkel","cat_id":-1,"style_id":-1,"abv":0,"ibu":0,"srm":0,"upc":0,"filepath":null,"descript":null,"last_mod":"2010-07-22 20:00:20","":null},{"_id":835,"brewery_id":745,"name":"Winter-Traum","cat_id":7,"style_id":84,"abv":5.4,"ibu":0,"srm":0,"upc":0,"filepath":null,"descript":null,"last_mod":"2010-07-22 20:00:20","":null},{"_id":836,"brewery_id":301,"name":"Poperings Hommel Ale","cat_id":3,"style_id":26,"abv":7.5,"ibu":0,"srm":0,"upc":0,"filepath":null,"descript":null,"last_mod":"2010-07-22 20:00:20","":null},{"_id":837,"brewery_id":907,"name":"Smoked Rye Bock","cat_id":8,"style_id":95,"abv":0,"ibu":0,"srm":0,"upc":0,"filepath":null,"descript":null,"last_mod":"2010-07-22 20:00:20","":null},{"_id":838,"brewery_id":1263,"name":"Russian Imperial Stout","cat_id":3,"style_id":42,"abv":0,"ibu":0,"srm":0,"upc":0,"filepath":null,"descript":null,"last_mod":"2010-07-22 20:00:20","":null},{"_id":839,"brewery_id":190,"name":"Jenlain St Druon de Sebourg","cat_id":-1,"style_id":-1,"abv":6,"ibu":0,"srm":0,"upc":0,"filepath":null,"descript":null,"last_mod":"2010-07-22 20:00:20","":null},{"_id":840,"brewery_id":196,"name":"Les Sans Culottes","cat_id":-1,"style_id":-1,"abv":7,"ibu":0,"srm":0,"upc":0,"filepath":null,"descript":null,"last_mod":"2010-07-22 20:00:20","":null},{"_id":841,"brewery_id":202,"name":"Bruocsella 1900 Grand Cru","cat_id":5,"style_id":70,"abv":0,"ibu":0,"srm":0,"upc":0,"filepath":null,"descript":null,"last_mod":"2010-07-22 20:00:20","":null},{"_id":842,"brewery_id":188,"name":"Scaldis / Bush Amber 12%","cat_id":-1,"style_id":-1,"abv":12,"ibu":0,"srm":0,"upc":0,"filepath":null,"descript":null,"last_mod":"2010-07-22 20:00:20","":null},{"_id":843,"brewery_id":590,"name":"Princess of Darkness Porter","cat_id":2,"style_id":25,"abv":4.6,"ibu":0,"srm":0,"upc":0,"filepath":null,"descript":null,"last_mod":"2010-07-22 20:00:20","":null},{"_id":844,"brewery_id":590,"name":"Impromptu Pale Ale","cat_id":3,"style_id":26,"abv":5,"ibu":0,"srm":0,"upc":0,"filepath":null,"descript":null,"last_mod":"2010-07-22 20:00:20","":null},{"_id":845,"brewery_id":590,"name":"Steinworthy Oktoberfest","cat_id":7,"style_id":84,"abv":6,"ibu":0,"srm":0,"upc":0,"filepath":null,"descript":null,"last_mod":"2010-07-22 20:00:20","":null},{"_id":846,"brewery_id":590,"name":"DSB / Dusters Special Bitter","cat_id":-1,"style_id":-1,"abv":5.6,"ibu":0,"srm":0,"upc":0,"filepath":null,"descript":null,"last_mod":"2010-07-22 20:00:20","":null},{"_id":847,"brewery_id":590,"name":"Bugeater Brown Ale","cat_id":3,"style_id":38,"abv":4.4,"ibu":0,"srm":0,"upc":0,"filepath":null,"descript":null,"last_mod":"2010-07-22 20:00:20","":null},{"_id":848,"brewery_id":590,"name":"Tin Lizzie Hefeweizen","cat_id":4,"style_id":50,"abv":5.5,"ibu":0,"srm":0,"upc":0,"filepath":null,"descript":null,"last_mod":"2010-07-22 20:00:20","":null},{"_id":849,"brewery_id":590,"name":"All-American Lager (discontinued)","cat_id":-1,"style_id":-1,"abv":0,"ibu":0,"srm":0,"upc":0,"filepath":null,"descript":null,"last_mod":"2010-07-22 20:00:20","":null},{"_id":850,"brewery_id":590,"name":"Heavenly Helles","cat_id":-1,"style_id":-1,"abv":5.3,"ibu":0,"srm":0,"upc":0,"filepath":null,"descript":null,"last_mod":"2010-07-22 20:00:20","":null},{"_id":851,"brewery_id":169,"name":"Orval Trappist Ale","cat_id":5,"style_id":72,"abv":6.9,"ibu":0,"srm":0,"upc":0,"filepath":null,"descript":null,"last_mod":"2010-07-22 20:00:20","":null},{"_id":852,"brewery_id":270,"name":"Trappist Bruin Bier / BiÃ¨re Brune","cat_id":-1,"style_id":-1,"abv":0,"ibu":0,"srm":0,"upc":0,"filepath":null,"descript":null,"last_mod":"2010-07-22 20:00:20","":null},{"_id":853,"brewery_id":7,"name":"Rochefort 8","cat_id":-1,"style_id":-1,"abv":9.2,"ibu":0,"srm":0,"upc":0,"filepath":null,"descript":"Yellowish-brown colour, with a more pronounced aroma, more fruits and a slight amount of Demi-Sec.

centuries-old Belgian text, 1554 Enlightened Black Ale uses a light lager yeast strain and dark chocolaty malts to redefine what dark beer can be. In 1997, a Fort Collins flood destroyed the original recipe our researcher, Phil Benstein, found in the library. So Phil and brewmaster, Peter Bouckaert, traveled to Belgium to retrieve this unique style lost to the ages. Their first challenge was deciphering antiquated script and outdated units of measurement, but trial and error (and many months of in-house sampling) culminated in 1554, a highly quaffable dark beer with a moderate body and mouthfeel.","last_mod":"2010-07-22 20:00:20","":null},{"id":1806,"brewery_id":135,"name":"Dark

Fancy Lawnmower Beer is a world class brew yet light enough to be enjoyed by Texans after strenuous activities, like mowing the lawn.\n\nSaint Arnold Fancy Lawnmower Beer is best consumed at 35-45Â° Fahrenheit.","last_mod":"2010-07-22 20:00:20","":null},{"id":2426,"brewery_id":34,"name":"Hofbrauhaus Brewery & Biergarten Vienna Velvet","cat_id":8,"style_id":95,"abv":0,"ibu":0,"srm":0,"upc":0,"filepath":null,"descript":null,"last_mod":"2010-07-22 20:00:20","":null},{"id":2427,"brewery_id":1240,"name":"India Pale Ale","cat_id":3,"style_id":26,"abv":0,"ibu":0,"srm":0,"upc":0,"filepath":null,"descript":null,"last_mod":"2010-07-22 20:00:20","":null},{"id":2428,"brewery_id":1254,"name":"Old Redwood Porter","cat_id":2,"style_id":25,"abv":5.5,"ibu":0,"srm":0,"upc":0,"filepath":null,"descript":null,"last_mod":"2010-07-22 20:00:20","":null},{"id":2429,"brewery_id":1351,"name":"Cloud Nine Witbier","cat_id":-1,"style_id":-1,"abv":0,"ibu":0,"srm":0,"upc":0,"filepath":null,"descript":null,"last_mod":"2010-07-22 20:00:20","":null},{"id":2430,"brewery_id":162,"name":"Doppel Bock","cat_id":7,"style_id":90,"abv":0,"ibu":0,"srm":0,"upc":0,"filepath":null,"descript":null,"last_mod":"2010-07-22 20:00:20","":null},{"id":2431,"brewery_id":496,"name":"Cyclops Barleywine","cat_id":-1,"style_id":-1,"abv":0,"ibu":0,"srm":0,"upc":0,"filepath":null,"descript":null,"last_mod":"2010-07-22 20:00:20","":null},{"id":2432,"brewery_id":411,"name":"Heavenly Hefe","cat_id":4,"style_id":50,"abv":0,"ibu":0,"srm":0,"upc":0,"filepath":null,"descript":null,"last_mod":"2010-07-22 20:00:20","":null},{"id":2433,"brewery_id":481,"name":"Climax California Classic","cat_id":-1,"style_id":-1,"abv":5,"ibu":0,"srm":0,"upc":0,"filepath":null,"descript":null,"last_mod":"2010-07-22 20:00:20","":null},{"id":2434,"brewery_id":505,"name":"Ironside Best","cat_id":-1,"style_id":-1,"abv":0,"ibu":0,"srm":0,"upc":0,"filepath":null,"descript":null,"last_mod":"2010-07-22 20:00:20","":null},{"id":2435,"brewery_id":726,"name":"Double Chocolate Stout","cat_id":3,"style_id":42,"abv":0,"ibu":0,"srm":0,"upc":0,"filepath":null,"descript":null,"last_mod":"2010-07-22 20:00:20","":null},{"id":2436,"brewery_id":818,"name":"Black Chip Porter","cat_id":2,"style_id":25,"abv":0,"ibu":0,"srm":0,"upc":0,"filepath":null,"descript":null,"last_mod":"2010-07-22 20:00:20","":null},{"id":2437,"brewery_id":816,"name":"Hop Daddy IPA","cat_id":3,"style_id":31,"abv":0,"ibu":0,"srm":0,"upc":0,"filepath":null,"descript":null,"last_mod":"2010-07-22 20:00:20","":null},{"id":2438,"brewery_id":880,"name":"Jackpot Pale","cat_id":3,"style_id":26,"abv":0,"ibu":0,"srm":0,"upc":0,"filepath":null,"descript":null,"last_mod":"2010-07-22 20:00:20","":null},{"id":2439,"brewery_id":436,"name":"Stuft Pizza Torrey Pines IPA","cat_id":3,"style_id":31,"abv":0,"ibu":0,"srm":0,"upc":0,"filepath":null,"descript":null,"last_mod":"2010-07-22 20:00:20","":null},{"id":2440,"brewery_id":980,"name":"Hard Woods Pale","cat_id":3,"style_id":26,"abv":0,"ibu":0,"srm":0,"upc":0,"filepath":null,"descript":null,"last_mod":"2010-07-22 20:00:20","":null},{"id":2441,"brewery_id":1001,"name":"Mother of All Beers","cat_id":-1,"style_id":-1,"abv":0,"ibu":0,"srm":0,"upc":0,"filepath":null,"descript":null,"last_mod":"2010-07-22 20:00:20","":null},{"id":2442,"brewery_id":1001,"name":"Cuvee de Tomme","cat_id":-1,"style_id":-1,"abv":0,"ibu":0,"srm":0,"upc":0,"filepath":null,"descript":null,"last_mod":"2010-07-22 20:00:20","":null},{"id":2443,"brewery_id":986,"name":"Gunslinger Imperial Stout","cat_id":3,"style_id":42,"abv":0,"ibu":0,"srm":0,"upc":0,"filepath":null,"descript":null,"last_mod":"2010-07-22 20:00:20","":null},{"id":2444,"brewery_id":390,"name":"Pale","cat_id":3,"style_id":26,"abv":0,"ibu":0,"srm":0,"upc":0,"filepath":null,"descript":null,"last_mod":"2010-07-22 20:00:20","":null},{"id":2445,"brewery_id":390,"name":"Hefeweizen","cat_id":4,"style_id":50,"abv":0,"ibu":0,"srm":0,"upc":0,"filepath":null,"descript":null,"last_mod":"2010-07-22 20:00:20","":null},{"id":2446,"brewery_id":390,"name":"Brandenburg Gate MÃ¤rzen","cat_id":7,"style_id":84,"abv":0,"ibu":0,"srm":0,"upc":0,"filepath":null,"descript":null,"last_mod":"2010-07-22 20:00:20","":null},{"id":2447,"brewery_id":68,"name":"Big Eye IPA","cat_id":3,"style_id":31,"abv":6,"ibu":0,"srm":0,"upc":0,"filepath":null,"descript":"ndia Pale Ale is a style of beer that was developed in England during the period of the British Empire. It is derived from bitter ales but contains even more alcohol and hops. This helped preserve the beer on its long sea journey around Cape Hope to India.\n\nBritish troops returning from India brought their love of this beer back with them so breweries began brewing it for the home market as well. Sadly, the style had mostly died out in England by the late twentieth century.\n\nAmerican home brewers began to brew I.P.A. because of their love for the intense hoppiness of the style. In time American I.P.A.s became much more aggressively bitter and hoppy than their historical predecessors.\n\nBig Eye I.P.A. is our version of this wonderful style.  American Centennial hops are  used exclusively to bitter, flavor, finish, and dry hop the Big Eye. Its full hop flavor is guaranteed to please the palate of the true hop head.","last_mod":"2010-07-22

character can arise from simple elements, this ale is made with three malts and one hop. Its light amber color and slightly spicy malt character are derived from the use of German Dark Munich Malt and Rye Malt respectively. North American 2-row barley combines with the other grains to lay the foundation for the hop onslaught to come. Summit hops are used exclusively in the boil for bitterness, flavor and aroma but it doesnâ€™t end there. Post-fermentation dry hopping allows the 9.5% ABV monstrosity to gently coax the citrus rind and grapefruit aroma to join the 100 IBUs already present. This beer should greet you with a pungent citrus blast, provide a spicy yet round middle and finish with a brisk, clean bitterness.","last_mod":"2010-07-22

This style was created by Trappist Monks in Belgium over 500 years ago. To be true to the style, Merry Monks' Ale is bottle conditioned. This means we add a bit of sugar and yeast just prior to bottling. This imparts a special effervescence to the beer, a creamier carbonation, and also extends the shelf life. The on-going fermentation inside the bottle will change the character of the beer as it ages, and you'll find it becomes dryer with age. You may want to lay down a few bottles for future evaluation. We suggest storing at cellar temperatures -around 55 degrees F- and away from light.\n\nWhen you try this beer you're in for a unique treat. The special effervescence and creaminess are immediately apparent when pouring.

It's smooth but not cloying, with a warming belt of alcohol (5.6% ABV).\n\nAlthough winter ales predate history, they are believed to have their origin in the pagan celebrations of winter solstice. Later, when monasteries produced the local brew, winter ales were made each year to commemorate the birth of Christ. Back then, winter ales were brewed full-bodied as a source of nutrition for the upcoming winter months. Today, winter ales are typified by their seasonality, their rich, malty flavors and by their deep, dark coloration.\n\nGenerally available November-March, Weyerbacher Winter Ale is the perfect libation for a winter meal, with good friends, or beside a warm fire fending off a cold winter night.","last_mod":"2010-07-22 20:00:20","":null},{"id":3922,"brewery_id":1352,"name":"AutumnFest","cat_id":7,"style_id":84,"abv":5.4,"ibu":0,"srm":0,"upc":0,"filepath":null,"descript":"AutumnFest is Weyerbacher's own unique twist on the German Oktoberfest style.

Because the ships had to cross the equator twice to get there, spoilage was a major problem until some clever brewer realized that both alcohol and hops are natural preservatives. James brews Hurricane I.P.A. in this tradition, and packs it with enough hops and alcohol to survive crossing the orbit of Mercury twice. The grist is 100% Gambrinus premium 2-row barley malt, copiously hopped with fresh Centennial and Willamette. The result is a rich, golden, intense beer with bitterness in perfect balance with residual sweetness.","last_mod":"2010-07-22 20:00:20","":null},{"id":4447,"brewery_id":1210,"name":"Black Plague Stout","cat_id":3,"style_id":42,"abv":0,"ibu":0,"srm":0,"upc":0,"filepath":null,"descript":"Derives its name from the historical fact that at one time in Europe beer was about the only safe liquid to drink.

Staying true to the experimental nature of the series and the â€œnever settleâ€ philosophy of Deschutes, our brewers went back to the drawing board to create an amplified version of last yearâ€™s monument to hops.\n\nHead Brewer Brett Porter says, â€œThis is a truly exciting and groundbreaking beer. We reformulated everything about the hop recipe to give Hop Henge an extraordinary aroma and flavor similar to a fresh hop beer.â€ In addition to the Cascade and Centennial hops, Deschutes Brewery is experimenting with a hop variety so new that it has yet to be named.\n\nThe team here at Bend Public House recommends Hop Henge as the perfect accompaniment for a variety of spicy foods, so be sure to have a bottle handy next time you make a batch of hot wings and go for the five alarm award. The high-octane hoppiness is a wildly refreshing antidote to a wide array of hot foods.\n\nLimited Availability April through June.\n\nDonâ€™t miss this amazing hop experiment that is sure to leave your taste buds begging for more.\n\n-http://www.deschutesbrewery.com/Brews/Bond+Street+Series/default.aspx\n\nAvailable April through June.\n\nHop Henge I.P.A. was first brewed in 2006 as an agressive West Coast style I.P.A. In 2007, Hop Henge is going Imperial!  Several pounds of  Centennial, Cascade and Northern Brewer hops are in each barrel with a heavy dry-hop presence to top it off.  A blend of crystal, pale and caraston malts creates an overall biscuity characteristic that is dense and muscular, building the alcohol base to support the monstrous hop profile.\n\nLike the rest of the Bond Street Series, Hop Henge highlights the creativity and curiosity of our brewers.  Bolder than its English ancestors, with huge hops and a bitter finish, this IPA is no wallflower.\n\nAlcohol By Volume: 8.1%\n\t\n\nIBU 95\n\nWhen one of our brewers suggested we name our new IPA Hop Henge, he also came up with the idea of actually recreating Stonehenge, only with hop bales.  We were up for the challenge and even though the weather did not want to cooperate, we pulled it off and threw a party afterwards.\n\t\n\n\nphoto: chris mather\nRatings, Awards & Notables\n\nWorld's Best Strong Pale Ale (Imperial IPA)\n2007 World Beer Awards\n\nWorld's 50 Best Beers\n2006 International Beer Challenge\n\nGold Medal, 92 Points\n2006 World Beer Championships\n\nSilver Medal, India Pale Ale Category\n2006 Australian International Beer Awards\n\nModern Brewery Age, February 12, 2007\n5 out 5 stars \nHop Henge started its life as an India Pale Ale, but this year it was bumped up to â€œImperial IPAâ€ status, with a hefty dose of additional hops.\nâ€œThis one is lovely,â€ said taster Tom Conti. â€œThey got it just right.â€\nIt pours out a deep amber, with an appealing rocky head, and rich hop aroma wafting from the glass. â€œThey sure dosed it with a lot of hops...[thereâ€™s] a lot of hop bitterness in the taste,â€ one taster observed.\nIn addition to the Imperial-level hopping, Hop Henge also boasts Imperial-level alcohol content, with 8.1% a.b.v.\nThis was the top-rated beer during its tasting session, and tasters had to dig deep for new superlatives to describe it. â€œThis is a beautiful beer,â€ concluded taster Gregg Glaser. â€œFull of flavor and hops and malt and hops again.â€\nâ€œNot for the timid,â€ said taster Robert Lachman.\n\n-http://www.deschutesbrewery.com/BrewPub/OnTap/125352.aspx","last_mod":"2010-07-22 20:00:20","":null},{"id":4633,"brewery_id":538,"name":"First Flight Amber Ale","cat_id":3,"style_id":33,"abv":4.5,"ibu":0,"srm":0,"upc":0,"filepath":null,"descript":"Our first beer brewed right here at Flyers.

This just goes to show how a hugely flavorful IPA can be loaded-up with fresh ingredients and come out the other end, a tasty LOW octane, treat! Bryan and I hope you get to stop in soon to try this one out! We decorated Bube's with some of the actual hop vines we pulled from. For the true hophead, you will be in heaven. And for the all-around beer enthusiasts, we hope you can appreciate the creativity in this beer.

The balance of flavors and complexity of aroma are recognized and appreciated by all who taste this fine brew.","last_mod":"2010-07-22 20:00:20","":null},{"id":5535,"brewery_id":1108,"name":"Chicken Killer Barley Wine","cat_id":3,"style_id":35,"abv":10,"ibu":0,"srm":0,"upc":0,"filepath":null,"descript":"Chicken Killer Barley Wine is the revolutionary beer that will someday define America's unique Barley Wine style.
